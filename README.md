# WCPS-Xamarin
Working WCPS app in Xamarin ported from objc. I ported Connor's WCPS App from objc to C#.

I couldn't get Connor's app repo to build properly in xcode due to missing files so I quickly created a simple port as a working example to look at. All of the app method names and syntax/property names should be fairly similar to the objc equivalents. If you want to checkout and run the this project please feel free to do so. You will need to download Xamarin from https://www.xamarin.com/download it is free to sign up and use. If you'd like to continue the project in Xamarin and code in C#, which you should find much easier to start learning than objc, you may use any of this code as a start point for your project. Also if you do decide to switch to C# instead of objc any questions you might have I'd be able to answer much quicker and easier.
